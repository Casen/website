                <h1>Hi, I'm Casen.</h1>
                <p>I've been fortunate to have helped build out technical infrastructure for businesses at nearly every stage of growth, and in that time I've learned more than I ever thought possible.</p>
                <p>One of my biggest passions is helping others learn and grow. For that reason I'm looking for opportunities to bring computer science education to youth who could use a hand up in life.</p>
                <p>Feel free to reach out if you'd like to work with me.</p>
